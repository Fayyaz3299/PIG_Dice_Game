# Premise of the game : Roll a die, get a number from 1-6 
# if you get anything other than 1 : Take it and add to the total 
# You can decide how many times you can roll the dice 
# If you hit a 1 whatever total resets to 0

# N Players compete and in the end we display Final Total and number of rolls of the winner (The player with the highest score)
# If its a tie! we display all winners details
